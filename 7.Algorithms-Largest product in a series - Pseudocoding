# Largest product in a series - Pseudocoding

1. Define the series of numbers as a string
2. Define the length of the series
3. Define the number of adjacent digits to multiply
4. Define a variable to keep track of the largest product
5. Loop through each digit in the series, up to (length - adjacent + 1)
6. Within the loop, convert the adjacent digits to a list of integers
7. Calculate the product of the integers in the list
8. If the product is larger than the current largest product, update the largest product
9. After the loop completes, return the largest product
