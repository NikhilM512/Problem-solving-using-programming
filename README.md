# Problem statements were prepared by kalvium community 

There are n number of programs solved on different topics and concepts

# Problem solving using programming
Problem solving using programming involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then using a programming language to develop a solution. 
## How can this be done?
* Define the problem: 
    Clearly understand the problem that needs to be solved. Define the input, output, constraints, and requirements for the solution.

* Develop a plan: 
    Break down the problem into smaller pieces and create a plan for how to approach each piece. Think about algorithms, data structures, and any other relevant programming       concepts.

* Write the code: 
    Use a programming language to write the code that implements the plan. Use appropriate data structures, control structures, and functions as necessary.
    (The programming languges used here are #Python and #C++)

* Testing: 
    Test the code thoroughly and identify any errors or issues before executing the code.

* Refine and optimize: 
    Once the code is working, consider ways to make it more efficient or optimize it further.

* Maintain and improve: 
    Finally, maintain the code over time and continue to improve it as needed based on changes to the problem or new requirements.
   

## Practice coding every day , atleast solve one problem every day to be more proficient in coding!!!
